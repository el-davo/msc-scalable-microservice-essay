\section{Brokers}

Brokers are where Kafka stores and maintains topics. The broker stores the topics on the underlying file-system of the machine it is running on. It is possible to run multiple brokers on one machine provided they do not have conflicting settings, however it is more common to have one broker per machine. These machines come together to form a kafka cluster. Brokers can be easily scaled out simple by adding another broker to the cluster. As of 2016, Linkedin has scaled to 1,400 brokers and processes over 2 petabytes per of data week\cite{linkedin:brokers}. Each broker needs a unique id within the Kafka cluster.
