\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we summarised each of the key parts that make up a Kafka architecture. We also looked briefly at Zookeeper and MirrorMaker. We also gave hands-on examples of running Kafka on a raspberry pi cluster, running Kafka locally on docker with docker-compose and created a small application for producing and consuming messages with NodeJS.
