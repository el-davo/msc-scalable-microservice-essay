abstract = {Summary This chapter discusses the basic methods of checking a fitted regression model. It talks about these in terms of fitting a straight line, and the basic methods apply generally whenever a linear model is fitted, no matter how many predictors there are. The chapter examines the lack of fit F‐test when the data contain repeat observations. It also analyzes the basic visual checks that can be made on the residuals and the Durbin‐Watson test for checking serial correlation. In the simple case of fitting a straight line, bias error can usually be detected merely by examining a plot of the data. The chapter summarizes the steps to be taken when the data contain repeat observations.}
